# helper_functions_10x
This repo will contain a script with functions that are used for 10x single cell data. These functions include: 

* Input/Output of sparse matrix format data (and other formats)
* filtering sparse matrices
* de-hashing samples

This repo may eventually become a pip installable library or may (at least partially) absorbed by Clustergrammer2. 

# Private Test Data
This repo contains pivate HIMC data that is used for demonstrating and testing functionality - so this specific repo will probably always remain private.
