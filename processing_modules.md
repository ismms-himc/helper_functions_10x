### Filter Debris
If GEX only, define debris based GEX UMI Sum (manually set based on plot). 

If HTO and GEX, defin debris based on not meeting GEX or HTO threshold. 

```
keep_gex ...
keep_hto ...

keep_cells = keep_gex + keep_hto
```

The debris cells are permanently filtered. Reduces from 700K/6M -> 10-20K cells.
